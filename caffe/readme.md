## OpenCV DNN module
in august 2017 opencv 3.3 was released. In this release of opencv DNN(Deep Neural Network) module was included.this module supports many deep learning frameworks such as Tensorflow, Caffe,PyTorch etc. primary contributor to the dnn module was Aleksandr Rybnikov put huge amount of work to make this module possible. however there also included a more accurate deep learning based face detector in to the official release of opencv 3.3 it is a caffe based face detector module can be obtain in the opencv github repository. there are link provided to pretrained weights of caffe framework but one can also train it's own image's in this module. this module consist of CNN structure which is based on "SSD framework with a ResNet Base network.".
